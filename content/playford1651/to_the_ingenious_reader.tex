\lettrine[lines=5]{T}{he} Art of Dancing called by the Ancient Greeks \textit{Orchestice}, and \textit{Orchestis},
is a commendable and rare Quality fit for yong Gentlemen, if opportunely and
civilly u{\s}ed. And \textit{Plato}, that Famous Philo{\s}opher thought it meet, that yong
Ingenious Children be taught to dance. It is a quality that has been formerly
honoured in the Courts of Princes, when performed by the mo{\s}t Noble
\textit{Heroes} of the Times! The Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, who{\s}e {\s}weet and
ayry Activity has crowned their Grand Solemnities with Admiration to all Spectators. This
Art has been Anciently handled by \textit{Atheneus}, \textit{Julius Pollux}, \textit{Celius Rhodiginus}, and others, and
much commend it to be Excellent for Recreation, after more {\s}erious Studies, making the body
active and {\s}trong, gracefull in deportment, and a quality very much be{\s}eeming a Gentleman.
Yet all this {\s}hould not have been an Incitement to me for Publication of this Worke (knowing
the{\s}e Times and the Nature of it do not agree,) But that there was a fal{\s}e and {\s}urrepticious
Copy at the Printing Pre{\s}{\s}e, which if it had been publi{\s}hed, would have been a di{\s}paragement
to the quality and the Profe{\s}{\s}ors thereof, and a hinderance to the Learner : Therefore
for prevention of all which, having and Excellent Copy by me , and the a{\s}{\s}i{\s}tance of a knowing
Friend ; I have ventured to put forth this en{\s}uing Worke to the view, and gentle cen{\s}ure
of all ingenious Gentlemen lovers of this Quallity ; not doubting but their goodnes will pardon
what may be ami{\s}{\s}e , and accept of the hone{\s}t Intention of him that is a faithfull honourer of
your Virtues, and\hfill \textit{Your {\s}ervant to command,}
